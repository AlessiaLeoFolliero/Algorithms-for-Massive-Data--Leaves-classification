# AMD: Algorithms for Massive Data 🌿

This project was developed as part of the **Cloud Computing and Algorithms for Massive Data** exam. The goal is to classify leaf species using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** in a multiclass classification task. The dataset used for this project was sourced from **DataCamp** and consists of ten labeled classes.

### 🛠️ Libraries Used
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `keras`
- `numpy`
- `tensorflow`

### 📊 Key Techniques
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**:  
  Performed using Keras' **Random Search**.  
- **Image Preprocessing**:  
  Critical for minimizing overfitting and improving model performance.

### 📈 Results
Achieved an overall classification accuracy of approximately **95%**.
